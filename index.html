          <p class="overview-text"><strong>India</strong>, a diverse and vibrant country located in South Asia, boasts a rich history spanning thousands of years, renowned cultural heritage, and significant contributions to art, science, and philosophy. Its vast geographical expanse of over 3.2 million square kilometers, bordered by neighboring nations and the Indian Ocean, adds to its captivating charm.
            Geographically, India is bordered by several countries, including Pakistan to the northwest, China and Nepal to the north, Bhutan to the northeast, and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. It is also surrounded by the Indian Ocean on its southern side, which provides India with a long coastline.
            India has a rich and ancient history that dates back thousands of years. It was the birthplace of major religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. Over the centuries, India has been home to great empires, dynasties, and kingdoms, including the Maurya, Gupta, Mughal, and Maratha empires.
            The country gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947, following a nonviolent resistance movement led by Mahatma Gandhi. Since then, India has adopted a democratic system of governance and has emerged as a federal parliamentary republic.

            <p class="indian-culture-text">Indian culture is incredibly diverse and encompasses a wide range of traditions, languages, religions, and customs. It is one of the oldest and richest cultures in the world, with a history that dates back thousands of years.</p>
            <p class="indian-culture-text">Religion plays a significant role in Indian culture, with Hinduism being the predominant religion followed by a large portion of the population. Other major religions in India include Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism, and Jainism. The coexistence of multiple religions has fostered an environment of religious tolerance and respect.</p>
            <p class="indian-culture-text">The concept of "unity in diversity" is central to Indian culture. Each region within India has its own distinct traditions, languages, art forms, and cuisine. The country's diverse geography and climate have shaped these regional variations. From the snowy Himalayas in the north to the coastal regions in the south, and from the desert landscapes in the west to the fertile plains in the east, India boasts a wide range of natural beauty.</p>
            <p class="indian-culture-text">Indian culture places a strong emphasis on family and community. The joint family system, where several generations live together under one roof, is still prevalent in many parts of the country. Respect for elders and strong family bonds are highly valued. Festivals are celebrated with great enthusiasm and bring communities together, with Diwali (Festival of Lights), Holi (Festival of Colors), Eid, Christmas, and many others being widely observed.</p>
            <p class="indian-culture-text">Art and literature have thrived in India for centuries. Indian classical music, with its intricate melodies and rhythms, is renowned worldwide. Classical dance forms such as Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Odissi, and Kathakali are celebrated for their grace, storytelling, and expressive movements. Indian cinema, popularly known as Bollywood, produces the largest number of films globally and is a significant part of Indian culture.</p>
